## What is *Trowel* ?
Trowel is made for helping you to create and customize visual components.

### The frameworks state of play
CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation are great to start projets because they provide solid bases to your front-end design. Sass and less versions of thoses librairies are even better because they allow you to customize the UI through variables like below:
```scss
// typical way to customize a framework with scss variables.
$button-primary-bg: rgb(31, 13, 51) !default;
$button-success-bg: rgb(55, 211, 189) !default;
$button-warning-bg: rgb(255, 176, 0) !default;
$button-danger-bg: rgb(253, 65, 100) !default;
```
But maybe you just need two themes for you button component or maybe you need to create a fifth theme. Today you cannot do this easily and quickly with variables and it makes framework painful to use when you need deep changes from your design.

### The *Trowel* way
Trowel is a Sass extension designed to create framework easier and quicker to customize. The key feature provided by *Trowel* is a new way to write scss variables: we will define into a single variable all the variants for a property.

If we translate in *Trowel variable* the previous example we will need a single variable:
```scss
// the trowel variable for button backgrounds
$button-bg: (
  '-primary': rgb(31, 13, 51),
  '-success': rgb(55, 211, 189),
  '-warning': rgb(255, 176, 0),
  '-danger': rgb(253, 65, 100),
) !default;
```
Then *Trowel* will loop over the map `$button-bg` and generate css declaration for each button variant.

You don't need `.btn--danger` button variant ? Just redefine the `$button-bg` variable without the `'-danger'` and you won't find it into your style.

You want to add an 'info' variant for your button component ? Rewrite the `$button-bg` map by adding a new entry with `'-info'` as entry and the color you want as value.
